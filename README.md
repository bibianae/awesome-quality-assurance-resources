# awesome-quality-assurance-resources
A collection of quality assurance resources I have found to be useful. This is currently a WIP and is divided into Data (inputs), Tools, Articles, and Other. I focus on usability, user experience, and security testing, so resources will reflect those; however, I will try to broadly cover all areas of QA I have experience in. It is currently somewhat disorganized. If you have any suggestions, please open an Issue and I can review your suggestion - thank you! ðŸ˜„
